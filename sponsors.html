  <p>DevOpsDSM uses a monthly rotating sponsor list. We want the comunity to be as involved as possible, so please send us a <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">twitter message</a> if you would like to be a future sponsor.
  Or even better, send us a pull request to add your company sponsor info below and let us know what dates you would like to sponsor.</p>

  <p>Sponsorship is easy. We just need some food and drinks! You can also have the first few minutes of the meeting to introduce your company.</p>
