## Agenda

We are going to use this meeting as a sort of "Open Spaces" meeting. We will use this time to find out what
people in the community are doing, need help with, and figure out future meeting topics!

Come and share your successes and struggles with your current teams and products. We would love to hear what works,
what doesn't, and how others can use your experiences.

See you there!
