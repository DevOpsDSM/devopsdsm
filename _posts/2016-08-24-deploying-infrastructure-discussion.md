## Agenda

We have had a few talks in recent months about cloud and hosted infrastructure. Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Chef and many others have
been brought up. Let's have a discussion on best practices, gotchas and anything else you want to discuss or ask questions about in group forum.

Here are some talking points:

- What cloud providers are you using?
- What are some drawbacks to your cloud or hosted provider?
- How much configuration management code are you writing?
- Do you pay for hosted services (like CloudSearch or SNS in AWS)?
- What types of services (paid or opensource) are you using to help manage your servers?
- How do you manage development environments?

Bring questions and ideas for everyone!
