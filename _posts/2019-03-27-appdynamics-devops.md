## Talk Description

The local AppDynamics team would like to stop by and share why many DevOps teams are beginning to adopt Application Performance Management (APM) tools as the source of truth for complex and distributed environments. As lots of DevOps driven cultures know, great end user and customer experiences is key to staying relevant. Letâ€™s show you how we can help different teams be on the same page and allow companies to focus on innovating and avoiding War Rooms and constant troubleshooting when applications are performing poorly.
