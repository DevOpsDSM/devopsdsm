## Why

There are many user groups in Des Moines, why add another? Well, we feel that there is a strong
need to community discussion and collaboration in the devops space. Our feeling is that many
companies in the area are doing similar things and could help each other out with some best
practices.

Things we would like to do in future meetings are:

* Lightening talks
* Small breakout group discussions
* Large group discussions
* Mini-hackathons
* Presenations

## Agenda

The first meeting will be an open forum to discuss future talks, topics, and format.
We will also bring a few devops topics to talk about if people are interested.
Please bring your own as well. Anything is fair game!

## Sponsor

Still working on a sponsor, but pizza and pop/non-pop beverages will be provided.
