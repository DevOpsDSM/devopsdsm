## Agenda

> Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.

> You’re doing continuous delivery when:
> - Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
> - Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
> - Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
> - You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand

> The key test is that a business sponsor could request that the current development version of the software can be deployed into production at a moment's notice - and nobody would bat an eyelid, let alone panic.

Sound great, right? But how do you get there? It's not easy, but it takes just a little bit to go a long way.

Luke Amdor will show how we at *Jack Henry / Banno* tackle Continuous Delivery followed by a conversation about how other companies approach CD.

If you're new to Continuous Delivery, please come with questions!

We'll cover using Continuous Delivery enabling tools such as:

 - Jenkins (MultiJob Plugin and more)
 - Chef
 - Nexus
 - Terraform
 - Packer
 - Docker
 - Marathon

Food and drinks will be provided!

You deserve it, we’re generating it: a much needed change in the IT industry. We are Dynamo and we’ve set out to redefine the IT Consulting and Recruiting solution- one human interaction at a time.

Our ambitious journey began in 2014 by two former executives of a global Fortune 500 company. After spending a collective 23 years in the industry as record-breaking top performers, they chose to walk away from it all, step outside their comfort zones, and build a transformational organization our employees, consultants, clients, candidates, and all of their families truly love and trust.

We are currently powering the IT industry in DevOps, Cloud, InfoSec, Data Analytics, Mobile, and Agile Software Development. If you think you have what it takes to join forces and you want to be a part of a bold story, redefining a growing, but fractured $27 billion industry that is ripe for innovation and change, please reach out, we’d love to chat.
