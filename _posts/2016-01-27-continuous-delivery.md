## Agenda

> Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.

> Youâ€™re doing continuous delivery when:
> - Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
> - Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
> - Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
> - You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand

> The key test is that a business sponsor could request that the current development version of the software can be deployed into production at a moment's notice - and nobody would bat an eyelid, let alone panic.

Sound great, right? But how do you get there? It's not easy, but it takes just a little bit to go a long way.

Luke Amdor will show how we at *Jack Henry / Banno* tackle Continuous Delivery followed by a conversation about how other companies approach CD.

If you're new to Continuous Delivery, please come with questions!

We'll cover using Continuous Delivery enabling tools such as:

 - Jenkins (MultiJob Plugin and more)
 - Chef
 - Nexus
 - Terraform
 - Packer
 - Docker
 - Marathon
