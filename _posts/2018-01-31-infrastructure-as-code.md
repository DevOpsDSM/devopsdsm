## Talk Description

Jessie Puls is a Systems Engineer at DHI Group, Inc.

I will talk about how our project evolved as we migrated into AWS, and how we went about testing configurations along the way to ensure as we moved through environments our environments were consistent, and repeatable. I’ll talk about challenges DHI has faced, and how we (often successfully) tried to mitigate the risks they presented while migrating Dice.com to AWS. 

One of our primary goals while creating infrastructure as code was to actually treat our infrastructure as we would code, and apply practices such as version management, testing, and continuous integration as we worked. We’ll talk about how we’ve used those practices to ensure consistency, and provide a level of confidence that is difficult to achieve otherwise.

Things we’ll cover:

 - We'll talk about how we use RSpec with the AWS SDK to verify resources are properly configured.
 - We'll talk (a bit) about how we use test kitchen to create and test puppet modules in a self-contained environment.
 - We'll cover how we use Serverspec to verify behaviors and configurations are running as expected in a live environment.
 - And finally we'll talk about how we’ve changed as an organization as a result of all of this work

See you there!
