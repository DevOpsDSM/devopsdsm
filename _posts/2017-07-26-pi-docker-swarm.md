## Agenda

Most of us have a few pi’s around the house. In this talk I’ll walk you through what you need to get started and what kind of hardware you need to get your own pi cluster setup. The second part of the talk I’ll walk through showing you how to setup docker swarm using Hypriot (hip-riot) OS and deploying a go app using docker swarm. I’ll have my 4 pi’s at the talk if you want to check it out as a demonstration.
