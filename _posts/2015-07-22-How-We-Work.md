## Agenda

For this meeting, we are going to do 10 minute lightening talks about how compaines operate internally.
We are asking for people to come and talk for a max of 10 minutes (no slides necessary) about how
DevOps works at their company. This talk doesn't have to be 100% DevOps related.

Things that would be nice to touch on or think about are:

* Type of software/infrastructure produced
* What does your infrastructure look like? (windows, linux, raspberry pi clusters?)
* How do you set up your infrastructure?
* How do you deploy code?
* Team member specialties
* Week-in-the-life walkthrough
* How well does DevOps fit your company?
* What does your company do well?
* What do you struggle with?
* What do you want to change?

<br>
These are all just sugestions, but just a starting point for things to think about.

We will take a few minutes after each talk for questions. The lightening talk format will be very
casual.

__NOTE:__
One thing we would like to stress is that there is no "right" way to operate your company or how DevOps
is performed. We would appriciate if everyone would be courtious while asking questions and presenting.
We want this exercise to be informative, not demanding or demeaning.

Our goal is to inform how others do things and for people to show off what they do well, and ask if anyone
can help with problem areas.

## Sponsor

Still working on a sponsor, but pizza and pop/non-pop beverages will be provided.
