## Talk Description

What is Kubernetes you say? From https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/:

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Luke will go over the fundamentals of Kubernetes and containers, what benefits it provides, and how to deploy applications to it. We'll be using a hybrid Windows/Linux cluster on Azure with different applications talking to each other.

If you're a developer interested in containers and Kubernetes, this talk is for you.

Speaker - Luke Amdor

Luke is a software developer that does a lot of infrastructure; the technical lead of the infrastructure team of the Banno business unit of Jack Henry and Associates.
