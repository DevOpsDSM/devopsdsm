## Talk Description

Having a good testing and deployment infrastructure is key to happy developers and efficient software release cycles. But with so many tools and methods out there, how do you get started?

Nate Rauh will teach us DevOps 101! Developers will learn how to get started with Travis CI to automate tasks like testing, building, and deployment. There will also be a basic introduction to tools like Terraform and Ansible to show how they can help create and manage infrastructure. The examples will use a JavaScript project, but conceptually can be applied to other languages.

Nate Rauh is a Full Stack developer for eFuneral in Des Moines, Iowa. He is a frequent Des Moines Web Geeks presenter and attendee, previously leading sessions in Angular and hardware MiDi hacking. Find him on Twitter at @NateThePirate.

See you there!
