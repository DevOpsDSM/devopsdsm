David Blank-Edelman, a Technical Evangelist at Apcera.

## Abstract:

Are you sitting in front of a cluster right now? Surely you are typing at a laptop running a cluster just like the ones you have in production. And the process of moving your efforts from the laptop up to production, is it silky smooth? Maybe not. Let’s talk about why.

## Description:

When Docker burst on the scene in 2013, one promise that excited both developers and operations people alike was the idea that a dev would create a container on her laptop that could then be shipped right up to production. Three years later, most people have realized that it may not be that simple.

In a world where we are building microservices and distributed systems, how can you ensure that the laptop you are typing at now is a step towards production-ready software and not a distraction from it? Let’s get deep down and dirty into the art of constructing useful clusters on our primary development/operations control machines and the challenges we face in the process.
