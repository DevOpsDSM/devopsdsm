## Agenda

Hosting applications has historically required maintaining servers and managing autoscaling.

AWS Lambda allows you to deploy a 50MB binary in an AWS region. Each AWS Lambda function can scale to 100 concurrent instances, and each is limited to 60 seconds of runtime.

Chad Brewbaker from Pillar Technology and DataCulture LLC will give a brief tutorial on how to use AWS Lambda then lead a discussion on how AWS Lambda can simplify application deployments.

We will try to cover:

* Writing and deploying simple AWS Lambda functions in Java and JS.
* Compiling and deploying AWS Lambda function binaries from C.
* Writing a simple REST API for an  AWS Lambda function with AWS API Gateway.

Food and drinks will be provided.
