## Agenda
If you’ve ever heard or said “It’s too painful to fix”, “I can’t get it to run locally”, “My build is never what I expect”, or any other variant then you and I have something in common. What I’ve learned is that no matter where you are there are always problems in the development life cycle. It’s what solution you can apply that makes the big difference. After working at an Enterprise for awhile and now a Startup I want to shed some light show some interesting comparisons that I’ve seen between both environments. This will be a high level talk, so we don’t get stuck in the technical weeds.


Fueled by silliness and coffee I ([@crolek](https://twitter.com/crolek)) try to create efficiency in everything I and others do. I spends a majority of his time in the Node/Front-end stack.
