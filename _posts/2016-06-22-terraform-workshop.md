## Agenda

Terraform provides a simple file based configuration language to manage infrastructure. Anything
from physical and virtual servers to dns can be managed with Terraform.

> Your servers may come from AWS, your DNS may come from CloudFlare, and your database may come from Heroku. Terraform will build all these resources across all these providers in parallel.
>
> Terraform codifies knowledge about your infrastructure unlike any other tool before, and provides the workflow and tooling for safely changing and updating infrastructure.


In this workshop, we will walk through the basics of terraform and how you can use it in your
company.

If you have a laptop, please bring it to follow along. If not, we can pair up.

## Speaker
