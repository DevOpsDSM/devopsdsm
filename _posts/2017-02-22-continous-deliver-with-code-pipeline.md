## Agenda

You want to move quickly, you want to keep your customers happy, you want to do Continuous Delivery. But the prospect of provisioning and maintaining infrastructure for Jenkins or Bamboo pipelines can be a daunting process. Maybe we can just go serverless...

Mike McCormick will go over the joys and sorrows of building a continuous delivery pipeline using Amazon's CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline products. We'll create a pipeline for a web application, commit some changes, and have the pipeline deliver our changes untouched by human hands. And we'll do it without provisioning a single server.

## Speaker

Mike McCormick is an independent consultant focusing on reducing the friction between your code and your production environment. He's been mucking about with build and deploy systems for quite some time (it's because he's really lazy and would rather have a machine do all the tedious bits).

## Sponsor

Food and drink will be provided by [TekSystem](https://www.teksystems.com).
