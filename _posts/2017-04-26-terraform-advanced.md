## Agenda

Terraform is a unique generic tool to manage the state of your infrastructure. If you have needed to automate your infrastructure, track changes, or even roll back changes, Terraform may be for you:

> Your servers may come from AWS, your DNS may come from CloudFlare, and your database may come from Heroku. Terraform will build all these resources across all these providers in parallel.
>
> Terraform codifies knowledge about your infrastructure unlike any other tool before, and provides the workflow and tooling for safely changing and updating infrastructure.

We will be building on a previous talk (not required though) and cover:
- Terraform Basics
- Usage
- State Backends
- Providers
- Modules
- Provisioners

There will be example code to follow along with or to look at in the future.

## Speaker

This workshop will be lead by Spencer Herzberg.

Spencer works as an independent consultant currently focusing on DevOps.

Food and drink will be provided by [TekSystem](https://www.teksystems.com).
