## Agenda

Want to work with others on implementing tests for your one off shell scripts, deployment
tools and infrastructure code? Well we have the workshop for you.

Come join us for a hands on workshop. This will be discussion workshop format with some set topics,
but please bring your own best practices and ideas to teach others.

What we would like to cover:

 - Testing shell scripts
 - Testing services
 - "Smoke Tests"
 - Testing whatever you want...
 - Bring your own topic

Bring a laptop and an ssh client. We will have some virtual machines to use so we are all
on the same versions of stuff.

If you can't make this meeting, no worries! We will do this again in the future.

Food and drinks will be provided.
