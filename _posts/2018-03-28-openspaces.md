## Talk Description

We are going to use this meeting as a sort of "Open Spaces" meeting. We will use this time to find out what people in the community are doing, need help with, and figure out future meeting topics! DevopsDaysDSM is coming up, so plan to talk about interesting talks to not miss!

Come and share your successes and struggles with your current teams and products. We would love to hear what works, what doesnâ€™t, and how others can use your experiences.

See you there!

## Amenities

Food and drink will be provided.
