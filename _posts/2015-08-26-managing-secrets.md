## Agenda

Managing application secrets have historically been a complex task from an ops perspective.
The last few years several tools have surfaced that aid in managing them in a safer manner.

Spencer Herzberg from Banno will lead a discussion on how Banno secret management works and
talk about some other tools that can help facilitate good secret management.

We will try to cover:

* What are secrets
* Secret storage
* Secret retrieval
* Auditing

The format will be a discussion so feel free to bring ideas from your own companies.

## Sponsor

Food and drinks will be provided.
