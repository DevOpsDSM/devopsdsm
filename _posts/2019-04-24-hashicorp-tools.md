## Talk Description

Developers are facing a lot of challenges adopting cloud and multi cloud. Routing, securing, deploying and running their apps and infrastructure is challenging and becoming more domain specific. Thankfully, HashiCorp has open source tools to alleviate these pain points and get teams focused on what matters: delivering applications. This talk will go over the HashiStack - Terraform, Vault, Consul and Nomad. We'll go over what they are, the problems they solve, and how to get started using them.

Food and drink will be provided!
