## Talk Description

Modern development teams are delivering features at a rapid pace using modern technologies such as containers, microservices, and serverless functions. Operations and infrastructure teams are supporting these rapid delivery cycles using Infrastructure as Code, Test Driven Infrastructure (TDI), and cloud automation. Yet, most security teams are still using traditional security approaches and can't keep up with the rate of accelerated change. Security must be reinvented in a DevOps world to take advantage of the opportunities provided by continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

This talk will introduce attendees to the SANS Secure DevOps Toolchain poster and explore the key phases of pre-commit and commit. In these phases, we will identify the key security controls and discuss the open source tools that integrate into the DevOps workflow. Attendees will walk away with a practical approach for building a successful DevSecOps program.
