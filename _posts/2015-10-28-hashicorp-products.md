## Agenda

If you have worked with anything related to microservices or virtualization, you may have used a product built by [Hashicorp](https://hashicorp.com/).

Hashicorp is an awesome company that builds some great products for developers. They have a wide variety of tools to help local development as well as production.

Spencer Herzberg will start a conversation about using their products for local and production usage. If you have used their products, bring your experience and be ready to share!
If you are new to their tools, come with questions!

We will try to cover these topics:

 - Virtualization (vagrant, otto, packer)
 - Configuration management of infrastructure (terraform)
 - Secret management (vault)
 - Distributed consensus (consul)


Food and drinks will be provided.
