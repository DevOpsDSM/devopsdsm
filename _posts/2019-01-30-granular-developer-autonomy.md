## Talk Description

Having trouble removing the silo between development and cloud
engineers? Wanting to understand how to be more proactive and less
reactive? We believe the answer is building software and abstractions for
developers - this talk will cover how we use software practices to increase
our level of cloud automation and developer autonomy across Granular.

Doors open at 5:30 for socializing and the presentation will start at 6pm.
