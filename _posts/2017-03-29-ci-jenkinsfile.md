## Agenda

Luke Amdor will be the speaker this month:

> Over a year ago, I did a presentation here at the DevOpsDSM about Continuous Delivery. At the time, I said Maybe the new work going on with Jenkins Pipelines will help... Well, after implementing them for us at Banno/Jack Henry, I can definitively say that it has helped.
> Jenkins Pipelines are a set of Jenkins jobs and plugins on steroids with the power of a Groovy DSL to mix it all together. It allows one to model a simple to a very complex continuous delivery pipeline as code and checked in with the source code itself.
> I'll go through how to use a Jenkinsfile from scratch all the way through deploying a Github project across environments using Kubernetes. Along the way, I'll go over some of the gotcha's and breakthroughs that we've learned while implementing this for our banking products.
