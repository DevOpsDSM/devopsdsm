## Agenda

Everyone's heard about Docker and how it's going to solve all of our problems, or not. In this session, we'll walk you through using Docker and discuss why using a scheduler and orchestration system is important. Then we'll dive into actual usage of the container application platform, OpenShift Origin, to show how it makes both Docker and Kubernetes accessible to the average human being. We'll keep the slides to a minimum and instead focus on live demo/coding/deployments. After deploying several containers, we'll turn up the heat by showcasing scaling and moving on to deployment strategies including blue/green.

Keith Resar is a Solutions Architect for Red Hat and a regular Open Source contributor.  He's consulted with dozens of organizations helping them successfully adopt IaaS and PaaS.  With an expertise in cloud automation and the Kubernetes-based OpenShift PaaS he's made deploying applications more accessible throughout the enterprise.
