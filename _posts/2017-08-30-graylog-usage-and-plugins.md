## Agenda

Need to start capturing logs from applications and servers but don't know where to put them?

Have tons of logs but can't easily use them for analytics and forensics?

Need to enrich logs or build custom dashboards and reports?

Well Graylog may be for you. In this talk, we will cover:

- What is Graylog
- Why Graylog (or tools like it)
- Graylog installation and configuration
- How to gather logs
- Development of custom Graylog plugins.

Come with questions and ideas on how you do or could use log aggregation tools.
