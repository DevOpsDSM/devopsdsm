  Our goal is to facilitate collaboration in Des Moines and the surrounding areas. With only meeting once a month, we needed a way to discuss upcoming
  topics and meeting formats. Since we already have a Github organization, we decided to have most of the conversation happen as Github Issues.

  <p>If you would like to join the conversation on upcoming topics or suggest new ideas, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DevOpsDSM/devopsdsm/issues">click here</a>.
